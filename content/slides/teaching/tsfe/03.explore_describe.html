## Rethinking visualisation

  - Charts are not meant to be *seen*, they are intended to be *read*
  - They are not just images but **visual arguments**.
  - Data doesn't *speak for itself*.
  - Data visualisations need to be **shown** and **explained**

## `ts` objects and `ts` function

A time series is stored in a `ts` object in R:
 - a list of numbers
 - information about times those numbers were recorded.

### Some fake daily returns

## `ts` objects and `ts` function

For observations that are more frequent than once per year, add a `frequency` argument.

E.g., monthly data stored as a numerical vector `z`:

```r
y &lt;- ts(z, frequency=12, start=c(2003, 1))
```

`tidyquant` loads:

  * **tq_get** function (for getting data from online sources)
  * **tq_transmute** function (for transforming between time frequencies)
  * **tq_mutate** function (create return series)

`tidyverse` loads many packages include:

  * **ggplot** plotting package
  * **dplyr** data wrangling package

## rethinking visualisation using `ggplot2` 

* `ggplot2` is based on [The Grammar of Graphics](http://amzn.to/2ef1eWp), 
* the idea that you can build every graph from the same components: a data set, a coordinate system or aesthetics, and `geoms`
* `geoms` visual marks that represent data points.

## Your turn

* Use `tq_get` to download the CBOE VIX Index from `2021-01-01` using the symbol `^VIX`
* create a time series object using the VIX index price.
* Plot this daily VIX Index Price using `autoplot`.
* What can you infer from this plot?

  **Hint:** the ts object of daily financial time series does not have a regular frequency to input into `ts()` function, so leave this argument blank.

## Why

--

.red[
* First, we use probability models to mimic variation in the world, and the tools of simulation can help us better understand how this variation plays out.] 

.font80[
- Patterns of randomness are notoriously contrary to normal human thinking
- Our brains don’t seem to be able to do a good job understanding that random swings will be present in the short term but average out in the long run
- And in many cases simulation is a big help in training our intuitions about averages and variation.

- .fancy[.red[Second, we can use simulation to approximate the sampling distribution of data and propagate this to the sampling distribution of statistical estimates and procedures.]]

- .red[Third, regression models are not deterministic; they produce probabilistic predictions.]

  - Simulation is the most convenient and general way to represent uncertainties in forecasts. 
  - Throughout this course and in our practice, we use simulation for all these reasons; 
  - In this lecture we introduce the basic ideas and the tools required to perform simulations in `R`.

## Why normal asset returns?
* Financial time series processes considered in this course:
* Return series
* Financial statement information
* Volatility processes
* Extreme events
* Multivariate series

---
class: middle
## Why assume normal asset returns?
* Normality assumption allows for asset returns properties to be tractable.
* Tractable mean and variance
  * They provide information about the long-term return and risk, respectively.
* Tractable symmetrical properties
  * Symmetry has important implications in holding short and long financial positions in risk management.
* Tractable kurtosis properties 
  * Kurtosis is related to volatility forecasting, efficiency in estimation and tests,etc.

---
class:middle
## Our first engineered robot

* To engineer a statistical model of asset returns we need to make some assumptions about the .red[data story or *data generating process*.]

.blockquote[

`$$\{R_{it}|i-1,\dots N;t=1,\dots,T\} \stackrel{i.i.d}\sim N (m_1,m_2)$$`


* A traditional assumption in financial analysis is the simple returns are independently and identically distributed (iid) as normal with a fixed mean `\(m_1\)` and variance `\(m_2\)`.
]

---
class: middle
## Our first engineered robot

* The previous assumption is unrealistic in a number of ways:
1. The lower bound of a simple return is -1, but a normal distribution has no lower bound.
2. Multiperiod simple returns `\(R_it[k]\)` is not normally distributed as it is the *product* of one-period returns.
3. Empirically, asset returns tend  to have *heavy tails* or **positive excess kurtosis**

---
class: middle
## Our second statistical robot: .small[lognormal distribution]

$$ \{r_{it}|i=1,\dots N ;t=1,\dots,T\} \stackrel{i.i.d}\sim N (\mu,\sigma^2) $$


* Another common assumption is that log returns are iid as normal with mean `\(\mu\)` and variance `\(\sigma^2\)`.
* As the sum of a finite number of iid random variables is normal, `\(r_t[k]\)` is also normally distributed.
* There is also no lower bound for `\(r_t\)`
* However, lognormal assumption is not consistent with **positive excess kurtosis**.

## Why care about the normal distributed variables?

.saltinline[
- In regressions the assumption of normality of model errors is one of the least important
- For the purpose of estimating the regression line it is barely important at all
- Diagnostics of normality of errors is not recommended unless the model is being used to predict individual data points.
]
---
class: middle
## Why care about the normal distributed variables?

- If the distribution of errors is of interest, perhaps because of predictive goals, this should be distinguished from the distribution of the data, `\(y\)`.
- **A regression model does not assume or require that predictors are normally distributed**
- Furthermore, the normal distribution on the outcome refers to the regression errors, not the raw data.
- Depending on the structure of the predictors, it is possible for data `\(y\)` to be far from normally distributed even when coming from a linear regression model.
- [See Gelman et al., (2020) Chapter 11 for more detail](https://doi-org.queens.ezp1.qub.ac.uk/10.1017/9781139161879.012)

## Null hypothesis significant testing

* Null hypothesis significance tests (NHST) are models.
* We assume an underlying data story with distributional properties which then allows us to create p-values based on null hypothesis.
* In practice they are often misused to create 'bright line' acceptance or rejection decision about underlying theoretical questions.
* In applied statistics the misuse 'p-values' in this framework is well understood 
* Econometrics has keep conspicuously silent on the matter.

## The DO NOTs of p-values

- The Do nots of p-values are well documented

1. Don’t base your conclusions solely on whether an association or effect was found to be “statistically significant” (i.e., the p-value passed some arbitrary threshold such as p&lt;0.05).

2. Don’t believe that an association or effect exists just because it was statistically significant.

3. Don’t believe that an association or effect is absent just because it was not statistically significant.

4. Don’t believe that your p-value gives the probability that chance alone produced the observed association or effect or the probability that your test hypothesis is true.

5. Don’t conclude anything about scientific or practical importance based on statistical significance (or lack thereof).

## There Are Many Do’s

- [Wasserstein, et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913) argue that the Do's from the dissonance can be summarise by the phrase

## Accept Uncertainty

- Statistical methods do not rid data of their uncertainty. 

- “Statistics,” [Gelman (2016)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/asa_pvalues.pdf) says, “is often sold as a sort of alchemy that transmutes randomness into certainty, an ‘uncertainty laundering’ that begins with data and concludes with success as measured by statistical significance.” 

- To accept uncertainty requires that we “treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm” [(Amrhein, Trafimow, and Greenland 2019)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1543137) 

- We must “countenance uncertainty in all statistical conclusions, seeking ways to quantify, visualize, and interpret the potential for error” [(Calin-Jageman and Cumming 2019).](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2018.1518266)

* `\(r_1\)` indicates how successive values of  `\(y\)`  relate to each other
* `\(r_2\)` indicates how  `\(y\)` values two periods apart relate to each other
* `\(r_k\)` is *almost* the same as the sample correlation between `\(y_t\)` and `\(y_{t-k}\)`.

- When data have a trend, the autocorrelations for small lags tend to be large and positive.
- When data are seasonal, the autocorrelations will be larger at the seasonal lags (i.e., at multiples of the seasonal frequency)
- When data are trended and seasonal, you see a combination of these effects.

- Time plot shows clear trend and seasonality.

- The same features are reflected in the ACF.

* The slowly decaying ACF indicates trend.
* The ACF peaks at lags 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, ..., indicate seasonality of length 4.

- Sample autocorrelations for white noise series.
- We expect each autocorrelation to be close to zero.

## Sampling distribution of autocorrelations

Sampling distribution of `\(r_k\)` for white noise data is asymptotically N(0,$1/T$).

  * 95% of all `\(r_k\)` for white noise must lie within `\(\pm 1.96/\sqrt{T}\)`.
  * If this is not the case, the series is probably not WN.
  * Common to plot lines at `\(\pm 1.96/\sqrt{T}\)` when plotting ACF.

- These are the .orange[.bold[critical values]].

## Autocorrelation

&lt;img src="03.explore_describe_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.blockquote[
- `\(T=36\)` and so critical values at `\(1.96/\sqrt{36}=0.327\)`.

- All autocorrelation coefficients lie within these limits, confirming  that the data are white noise. (More precisely, the data cannot be \\
distinguished **from white noise**

- The [AAII Sentiment Survey](https://www.aaii.com/journal/sentimentsurveyarticle) measures the percentage of individuals who are bullish, bearish, and neutral about the stock market over the next six months.

* Difficult to detect pattern in time plot.
* ACF shows some significant autocorrelation on all 30 lags.
* After `\(r_{15}\)` there seems to be a undulating pattern.
* These show the series is **not a white noise series**.

Noise makes trading in financial markets possible, and thus allows us to observe prices in financial assets. [But] noise also causes markets to be somewhat inefficient…. . Most generally, noise makes it very difficult to test either practical or academic theories about the way that financial or economic markets work. We are forced to act largely in the dark

[Fisher Black, “Noise”, Journal of Finance ,41 ,3 (1986) p529](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1986.tb04513.x)

## Financial Data Forecastability

  - Predictability of an event or quantity depends on several factors
  1. How well we understand the factors that contribute to it
  2. How much data are available
  3. Whether the forecast can affect the thing we are trying to forecast

## Signal and the Noise

  - High quality models identify the signal from the noise in financial data.
  - The **signal** is the regular pattern that is likely to repeat.
  - The **noise** is the irregular pattern which occurrs by chance and unlikely to repeat.
  - Overfitting or data snooping can result in your model capturing both **signal** and **noise**.
  - Overfitted models usually produce poor predictions and inferences.
